# About VendyAwards 

Vendy Awards is a Meteor application providing UH students with an opportunity to vote on which snacks get placed in campus vending machines. Every month will consist of:

1. Nomination period. During this time, students and vendors can nominate foods for the vending machine. Admins can ensure that the nominations are appropriate and feasible. The vendors must indicate how easily they can make a food item available.

2. Voting period. During this time, students can vote for their top 5 foods. They can also try to get their friends to vote.

3. Contest winners. During this time, the site indicates what foods won, and publicize when and how the vendors will make those foods available.
